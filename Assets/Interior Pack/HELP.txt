BUILDING
The easiest & quickest way to build your home is to use the premade rooms and homes (CHIP_Prefabs/PRE_Homes & PRE_Rooms). Just drag & drop your preferred prefab into the scene. Then customize everything from wallpaper to lighting for your project and you're done! You can also start from scratch by building your own rooms and homes. Just use the different building pieces (PRE_Walls, PRE_Ceilings, PRE_Floor, etc.) and drag them into place. I prefer to snap them into place by moving the object while holding down the "V" key.

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE?
Almost every object in this asset pack comes with multiple different material options. Just choose the object and then the material slot you wish to change. In the material selection screen you can see a list of materials that are all specifically named to let you know what material fits your object. For example if the material you wish to change is named "MAT_DEC_Rug_01_01_01" that object can use all materials named between "MAT_DEC_Rug_01_01_01" and "MAT_DEC_Rug_01_06_05". If you are unsure, just try the new material and see if it looks okay!

Also keep in mind that you can always create your own variations of each material. Just duplicate the material and change the color, texture or tiling to your liking.

SCALE
Remember that if something feels off-scale to you, just choose the object and scale it to your desired size!

TEXTURE SIZE
If you feel that an object's texture is not large enough, you can check if the material has a larger version (these materials have the word "larger"). If you wish to create a larger version of the texture yourself you can create a duplicate material and change the texture tiling setting, but remember that this only works well with tiling textures!

SEAMS
You will get rid of most visible seams by adjusting the lighting and settings of your project, but I recommend using the "Simple Mesh Combine" asset or something similar from the asset store. If you combine the walls, floors and ceiling meshes you will get rid of all seams once and for all!

I CAN'T SEE MY PREFAB THUMBNAILS
Choose the entire prefab folder and reimport the assets.

VIRTUAL REALITY
This asset has been used by many VR enthusiasts to build their own creations, but as VR development differs from basic desktop development you will have to customize the content to fit your purposes. Some objects feel off-scale in VR although they are based on real life measurements so be sure to go over your scene and correct anything that might "feel weird" in VR. The asset's default lighting also needs to be optimized for VR projects, so if your project is running slow, start with adjusting your lighting settings.

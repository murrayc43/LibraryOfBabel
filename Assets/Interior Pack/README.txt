COMPLETE HOME INTERIOR PACK V3.0

An extremely versatile and affordable set of interior items and building pieces: walls, floors, ceiling, windows, doors, furniture, appliances, electronics, decor, props and even food - in other words EVERYTHING you need to build, furnish & decorate your home!

Lightweight enough for mobile projects, but detailed enough for 1st person view projects! Tested with Oculus Rift and with some optimization it's suitable for your virtual reality projects!

All assets come with ready-to-use prefabs varying in style, but if you can't find what you like - it's easy to customize. From cute to modern, you have plenty of colours and materials to choose from.

Building your home is easy, quick and fun! Just drag & drop an asset into your scene. If you don't want to build, just use the ready-made 30 rooms and 5 complete homes. All in all this pack comes with a whopping 157 models and 1900 prefabs.

All furniture and appliances are designed to be opened and closed!

As an added bonus you get 50 Nekobolt demo items from 4 of our asset packs - ranging from toothpaste to breakfast cereal!

We will be adding more content to this pack and the price will go up, but everyone who already owns the package will of course get all updates for free.
